## StockBot README
### Overview

StockBot is an intelligent trading bot designed to assist with stock trading by providing graphical representations and forecasting of trading strategies for specified indexes. The bot integrates real-time data, news sentiment analysis, and machine learning models to execute and evaluate trading strategies.

### Features
Automated Trading: Executes trades based on real-time market data and news sentiment analysis.

Backtesting: Evaluates trading strategies using historical market data.

API Integration: Provides an API for managing trading strategies and retrieving results.

Graphical Representation: Visualizes trading performance and forecasts.

Containerization: Uses Docker for consistent and portable deployment.

### Technologies Used
1. Lumibot Library: For creating and backtesting trading strategies.

2. Alpaca-trade-api: Accesses real-time and historical market data and executes trades.
3. Gitpod: Cloud-based development environment.
4. GitHub: Version control and project management.
5. Miro: Collaborative whiteboard for brainstorming and planning.
6. Python: Programming language for developing the bot.
7. Hugging Face: Sentiment analysis with pre-trained NLP models.
8. Docker: Containerization for deployment.
9. FastAPI: API framework for managing strategies and retrieving results.

### Installation
Clone the Repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Charity-Mutembei/stocktraderbot.git```.

 and then

```cd stoctraderkbot```

### Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file and add your API keys and other configuration details:

example
```
Key=your_alpaca_api_key
Secret=your_alpaca_api_secret
Endpoint=your_alpaca_endpoint
```
Install Dependencies:

I believe that the requirements.txt has the dependencies you need.
so just!!

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Application:

```
python main.py
```
### Usage

1. Initialize the Strategy:
Modify the MLTrader class to set up your trading parameters.

2. Run Backtesting:
Use the strategy() function to backtest your trading strategy with historical data.

3. Start Trading:
Execute the trading bot by running the main script. The bot will trade based on real-time data and news sentiment analysis.

### Project Developments
1. Implemented Trading Strategy:

Developed using Lumibot and integrated with Alpaca API.
Utilized sentiment analysis with Hugging Face models.
Set Up Infrastructure:

Established a cloud-based development environment with Gitpod.
Containerized the application using Docker.
Created API and Backtesting:

Developed an API layer using FastAPI.
Implemented backtesting with YahooDataBacktesting.

### 2. Challenges Faced

High Computational Demands:

Managing large logs and dependencies like Torch required powerful machines, leading to software struggles.
Transitioned to using Gitpod for a more stable development environment.
Learning Curve:

Faced challenges with learning Docker in a short timeframe.

### 3. Next Steps
Optimize and Scale:

```
Enhance the trading strategy for better performance.

Scale the infrastructure to handle larger datasets.
```
Technology Enhancement:

```
Explore integrating LangChain to replace Torch and simplify the ML model.

Improve the sentiment analysis module.
```
Feature Expansion:

```
Develop a comprehensive web interface.

Integrate additional data sources.
```
User Testing and Feedback:

```
Conduct user testing and implement feedback for improvements.
```
Deployment and Maintenance:

```
Deploy the final version for public use.

Establish a maintenance plan.
```
